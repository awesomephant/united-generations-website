  "content": "## Manifesto\n\nDesign and architecture are dead. Pretty variations of the same objects, colours, forms are not enough anymore. Our society needs are beyond aesthetics and function. We need to shift from ego-centrism to care-centrism. Rebels of a new era, we defend a more long-lasting, sustainable, and social-solutions based future. We must reuse, reintegrate, retrain, remarket the available resources. A universal, simple, and sustainable environment must be created for a healthier and longer life. Infrastructures, objects, and services, both virtual and physical, must be designed for the needs and dreams of the next old and new generations. The United-Generation Era must start.\n\n## The Vision\n\nThe United Generations was founded by Adalberto Lonardi to create cultural and educational spaces for the older and newer generations partnering up with established industry professionals, charitable institutions and local councils. To support the elders and most vulnerable, The United Generations commits to donating to local charitable organizations part of the income derived from public art commissions.\nWhen the older population needs to be reconnected more than ever with the younger one, The United Generations proposes to go back to ancient archetypes where community, sustainability, and simplicity are the assets for a prosperous living.\n\n## Adalberto Lonardi\n\nAdalberto Lonardi is a visionary artist and director developing creative strategies for the social needs of tomorrow. After earning a Masterâ€™s degree at the Royal College of Art and training as a designer at FABRICA, Adalberto has worked for the past ten years in the creative and marketing sectors and founded his interdisciplinary practice [AL](https://adalbertolonardi.com/).\n\n## Supported by KLS\n\n[Katherine Low Settlement](https://www.klsettlement.org.uk/) is a community centre that has been at the heart of the community in Battersea, South West London, since 1924. KLS runs a range of community services, campaigns for social change and supports young people, families, older people, women and refugees communities.\n\n## Conscious Design\n\nThis website is designed with an inclusive and sustainable mindset to reflect the core values of the project. To make the website more accessible to everyone, we used an intuitive layout, keyboard navigation, images' alt-text caption, simple language, and good colour contrast. To reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions, we implemented systems fonts, optimized images, clean code, and improved SEO.\nDesign by [Max Koehler](https://maxkoehler.com/)\n\n## Contact\n\n[ug@adalbertolonardi.com](mailto:ug@adalbertolonardi.com)"
