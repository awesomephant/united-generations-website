  "content": "## Manifesto\n\nDesign and architecture are dead. Pretty variations of the same objects, colours, forms are not enough anymore. The society needs are beyond aesthetics and function. We need to shift from ego-centrism to care-centrism. Rebels of a new era, we defend a more long-lasting, sustainable, and social-solutions based future. We must reuse, reintegrate, retrain, remarket the available resources. A universal, simple, and sustainable environment must be created for a healthier and longer life. Infrastructures, objects, and services, both virtual and physical, must be designed for the needs and dreams of the next old and new generations. The United-Generation Era must start.\n\n## Values\n\nSimplicity\\\nSustainability\\\nCommunity\n\n## Vision\n\nEmpower older generations\\\nBridge gap between generations\n\nSupported by the [Katherine Low Settlement](maxkoehler.com).\n\nVolunteering at Katherine Low Settlement helped to understand the needs, challenges, and dreams of older people. To experience how they live. To learn to talk to them. To be patient. To be respectful and see their perspective. To understand more how a community center works, what kind of activities are offered, when, and why.\n\n## Contact\n\n[info@adalbertolonardi.com](maxkoehler.com)"
