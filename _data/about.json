  "intro": "The United Generations presents the research and spin-off led project directed by Adalberto Lonardi about sustainable design strategies to empower the older population and bridge the gap between different generations.",
  "content": "## Manifesto\n\nDesign and architecture are dead. Pretty variations of the same objects, colours, forms are not enough anymore. Our society needs are beyond aesthetics and function. We need to shift from ego-centrism to care-centrism. Rebels of a new era, we defend a more long-lasting, sustainable, and social-solutions based future. We must reuse, reintegrate, retrain, remarket the available resources. A universal, simple, and sustainable environment must be created for a healthier and longer life. Infrastructures, objects, and services, both virtual and physical, must be designed for the needs and dreams of the next old and new generations. The United-Generation Era must start.\n\n## Values\n\nIn a time when the older population needs to be reconnected more than ever with the younger one, The United Generations proposes to go back to ancient archetypes where community, sustainability, and simplicity are the assets for a prosperous living. The platform rotates around a system of collaborations with council, institutions and designer which envision and practice the same social and environmental values. \n\n## Vision\n\nThe United Generations wants to create an ecosystem of physical and digital spaces of education and culture for old and new generations based on sustainable, integrated and caring economies where wellbeing is the new economic value.\n\n## Design\n\n*This website is designed with an inclusive and sustainable mindset. To make the website more accessible to everyone, we used an intuitive layout, keyboard navigation, images' alt-text caption, simple language, and good colour contrast. To reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions, we implemented systems fonts, optimized images, clean code, and improved SEO.*\n\n## Supported by\n\n[Katherine Low Settlement](maxkoehler.com).\n\n## Contact\n\n[info@adalbertolonardi.com](maxkoehler.com)"
