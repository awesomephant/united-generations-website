  "content": "## The Vision\n\nThe United Generations proposes to go back to ancient archetypes where community, sustainability, and simplicity are the assets for a prosperous living. The United Generations was founded by Adalberto Lonardi to create cultural and educational spaces for the older and newer generations partnering up with established industry professionals, charitable institutions and local councils. To support the elders and the most vulnerable, The United Generations commits to reinvest 100% of the profit derived from private commissions and sales to create community-based art and design projects in London. \n\n## Adalberto Lonardi\n\nItalian-born Adalberto Lonardi is a multidisciplinary artist, working at the intersection of art and design and with a focus on local communities. He develops creative strategies to empower community groups through his design and art.\nAfter training as a designer at Fabrica by Benetton and earning a Master’s degree in Interior Design at the Royal College of Art, Adalberto worked in the arts and design fields and set up his studio. He won the RCA School of Architecture 2020 Student of the Year Award and the Climate/ Spatial Justice Prize for The United Generations project. Adalberto’s practice interweaves culture and design with art education at all age and ability levels; his style is marked by the simplicity of forms yet bold in aesthetics thus making it accessible to his students and audiences alike. His art seeks to enable local voices and help transform their collective vision into art and design – by the community for the community. \n\n## Supported by KLS\n\n[Katherine Low Settlement](https://www.klsettlement.org.uk/) is a charity that has been at the heart of the community in Battersea, South West London, since 1924. KLS runs a range of community services, campaigns for social change and supports young people, families, older people, women and refugees communities.\n\n## Contact\n\n[ug@adalbertolonardi.com](mailto:ug@adalbertolonardi.com)"
