In last year publication “ How to take care of the old” I started observing my parents ageing implications and investigating how my practice could contribute to their and other people’s quality of life.

I focused my research on the socio-economical advantages of old and young interactions and I chose to design spaces and activities to facilitate the gathering of different generations together.

It all begins taking in consideration the quality of life during a lifetime represented here in a virtual three-dimensionalization.

Volunteering weekly at Katherine Low Settlement, an elderly community centre in Battersea, helped me understand the needs, challenges and dreams of older people. To learn from them. To talk to them. And discover what kind of activities are offered, when, and why. Katherine Low Settlement is currently the supporter of 'The United Generations project.

[](https://adalbertolonardi.com/projects/take-care-of-the-old/)From research, interviews, and workshops, these are the most common activities (soft infrastructures) found among different generations which I analysed and linked to possible related yet different spaces (hard infrastructures).

Through interviews, workshops, volunteering experience, and talks, I concluded that the eight ecosystems most common among the old and young generations are: 
**Nature, Care of the Body, Exercise, Work, Arts, Spirituality, Farming and Food**.
