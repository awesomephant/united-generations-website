## Design and architecture are dead. Pretty variations of the same objects, colours, forms are not enough anymore. The society needs are beyond aesthetics and function. We need to shift from ego-centrism to care-centrism. Rebels of a new era, we defend a more long-lasting, sustainable, and social-solutions based future. We must reuse, reintegrate, retrain, remarket the available resources. A universal, simple, and sustainable environment must be created for a healthier and longer life. Infrastructures, objects, and services, both virtual and physical, must be designed for the needs and dreams of the next old and new generations.The United-Generation Era must start.
