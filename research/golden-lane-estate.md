This is the Golden Lane Estate, the city in the city.  A urban microcosm designed by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon to promote the modernist principles of wellbeing and social living. An example of 1960 utopian architecture.  The perfect site to test the flourishing of a more intergenerational community. The design strategy adopted by the architects aimed to create domestic and communal living around four courts connected by ground and underground levels and walkways.
