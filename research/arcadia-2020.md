This is a short illustrated story of care, sustainability and wellbeing between old and new generations. A journey of a day, a year, a generation through Arcadia, the citadel of nature, conviviality, and renewable resources.

## I. Prologue

"London has changed. Due to the climate crisis of 2019, the council decided to convert main streets and paved surfaces into green public spaces, repurpose public rooftops and private terraces for farming and allow nature to grow spontaneously to absorb toxic agents. The 2020 pandemic made metropolitan citizens rethink shared spaces and the relationship with people and other species. Larger spaces for new and old generations, Essential spaces. Spaces for conviviality, inclusiveness, and learning."

## II. Crescent House Apartments

"It all starts on the friendship bench. Outside the Crescent House apartments on an autumn morning, the neighbors gather to pause and nourish their relationships surrounded by pets and plants. On top of them, solar panels and water collectors provide renewable resources to the community. While the chestnut benches with armrests for the elders offer moments of interactions between neighbors on the apartments’ communal pathways, indoor balconies extensions ensure shared spaces within the inhabitants."

## III. The Work/Shops

"It is fall, it is winter. One of the adaptable laboratories, part of the Work/Shops strip hosts the production of ceramic vessels run by the older residents. The young ones observe, learn, and reproduce. The tradition is kept and the outcome will be sold on the bright ground floor to feed the economy of the community. The Work/Shops are a series of converted older shops and basements dedicated to the disciplines of art&crafts, reuse, technology, and research. Conceived as permeable double-height volumes, they connect the high-street to the Arcadian Gardens."

## IV. The Arcadian Gardens

"Outside the laboratories, underneath the previously forgotten underground colonnade, a strip of stables is the home of the farm animals. While the production activities are happening in the laboratories, children and the retired residents feed, nurse and pet other species, adopting them for a day, a month, or forever.\
In front of the stables between two hills, a watering hole emerges in a valley of wild-flower fields, fruit trees, and medical plants. We are at the center of the Arcadian Gardens where chestnut benches offer to young and old a moment of meditation and seasonal natural landscape opportunities for picking, seeding, and bloom watching."

## V. The Kitchen Club

"On a sunny spring lunch, a cooking session is happening in the Kitchen Club underneath the new flourishing pergola extruded from the inherited iconic canopy of the tower. A famous retired chef from the public is invited to tutor the younger ones on how to preserve pickles vegetables which will be sold to feed the community. The panorama terrace has been converted into a place for cooking performances and homemade food. The central elevator brings the guests directly to the rooftop where they attend cooking classes, dine in between shimmering curtains, take away food from the deli displays, or sip a cocktail on top of the canopy to the soothing tunes of the United Radio Station."
