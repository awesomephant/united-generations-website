In a time when the older population needs to be reconnected more than ever with the younger one, I propose to go back to the Arcadian archetype where community, sustainability, and simplicity are the assets for a prosperous living. Arcadia is a vision of pastoralism and harmony with nature. A poetic space associated with generous natural splendour and harmony. Arcadia is a Garden often inhabited by shepherds which live close to nature, uncorrupted by virtuous and civilization.

Could Arcadia be a contemporary living model to create meaningful connections between old and new generations, based on a sustainable, integrated and caring economy where wellbeing is the new economic value?
