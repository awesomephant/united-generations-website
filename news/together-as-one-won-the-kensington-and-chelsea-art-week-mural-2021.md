introduction: The winning mural “Together as One” celebrates the power of the
  Notting Hill Community as a symbol of hope and harmony. The artist was
  inspired by both the history of the neighbourhood and the site’s architectural
  restoration.

The mural depicts three stories of Notting Hill through time. The first panel celebrates the area as a pottery and pig farm village in the 19th century, showing ceramic production among young and old residents surrounded by animals with the iconic kilns in the background.

The second panel represents an early Portobello Market- now an iconic establishment that shows the relationship between fruit and vegetable vendors and customers which has been vital to adding to the rich vibrancy of the borough’s streets.

The third panel shows the intimate moment of a family preparing for the Notting Hill Carnival inside a recently renovated Georgian house.

For the artist, it was important to show the value in reconnecting with our history, our traditions and the people who shaped us to essentially find who we truly are; “As artists, citizens and human being, we need to celebrate the simple and essential moments of life”

The style of the mural presents strong symmetrical patterns and uplifting colours according to the Vaastu Shasta design principles. For the team at Studio Indigo, the practice of Vaastu has been the pillars of the project – originally a Hindu practice that aims to establish a synergy between humans and the Pranic energy of the universe, creating a positive relationship between the two.

The mural will be hand painted on site by the artist in late January 2021.
