For all its sculptural qualities, most of us never experienced the monolith as a sculpture, but as photographs of one, appearing (to paraphrase the art critic John Berger) not on the austere walls of a gallery, but the screens of our phones and laptops in our homes.

We have been looking at works of art in this way for a long time: Berger wrote his seminal book *Ways of Seeing* in 1972, when television sets had just entered the home, and Walter Benjamin saw the trend in the 19th century, when photo-engraving had made the mass-reproduction of paintings possible for the first time. But usually there is at least the option (however theoretical) to go see a work in person. This wasn’t the case with the monolith — not only was it installed in an inaccessible location, but we’ve been confined to our homes for months; and travel between states, let alone countries is a distant memory for most of us.
