In this moment of darkness, the light comes from the values we can restore. Restore relationships, traditions, cultures, and ecosystems. The sense of belonging to a family, to a group of friends and the community is essential to look at a radiant future. As artists, citizens and human being, we need to celebrate the simple and essentials elements of life.

Restore is about the celebration of the sense of belonging as a symbol of light. Inspired by mystical stained glass windows, the drawings represent the Mason’s Arms Pub community around a dining table as a space to restore conviviality and togetherness among young and old generations. The drawing style is a unique feature of my artworks, continuing and evolving ‘The United Generations’ project. Developed as a universal pictorial language, it encourages simplicity, inclusivity and personal interpretation. The drawings are the outcome of an iterative process which includes computer rendering, creative software and hand painting.
