introduction: The research looks at the relationships between gerontology and
  the disciplines of architecture, sociology, and technology. These fields
  inform the understanding of the fundamental behaviours and needs of the
  elderly and possible future solutions such as co-design, multigenerational
  living, and smart-homes to guarantee the future generations' a healthy and
  comfortable late life.

The concept of aging successfully has become increasingly crucial as statistics predict that the total number of individuals over 65 is projected to nearly double before 2050. The urban environment directly impacts the engagement profiles of older adults, and it is necessary to provide spaces designed to match the needs of the elderly. Based on my motherâ€™s concerns and anticipations of her future, this book investigates how architecture, design, and technology can be age-friendly, mitigating some of the losses that come with old age.
