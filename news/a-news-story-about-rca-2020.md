introduction: The United Generations Work in Progress research is presented by
  Adalberto Lonardi in conversation with Studio Jenny Jones on LIVE!, a digital
  platform created by Gianluca Alla to fight the stillness of the pandemic
  lockdown.
---
The energetic talk focuses on the importance of a multigenerational world and the care of the older population in a fully sustainable community. After a brief introduction of the reasons why the projects started and the research about wellbeing in the late stage of life, [Studio Jenny Jones](https://studiojennyjones.com/) and [Adalberto Lonardi](https://adalbertolonardi.com/) engage in a back to back conversation which explains the pillars of The United Generations projects: from the Golden Lane Estate in London which hosts the project to the architectural, design and art development and the questions the author wishes to arise within the community.
