introduction: Together as One officially opened to the public on 7 Lansdowne
  Road in Notting Hill. The new and old generations of the neighbourhood can now
  enjoy the artwork directed by Adalberto Lonardi. The artwork is part of “Love
  Kensington + Chelsea”, a public art initiative that celebrates the histories
  of the area with beautiful, temporary artworks on construction hoardings,
  created by local artists and chosen by public vote. In collaboration with
  Royal College of Art, London Projects, and Studio Indigo.

The mural depicts three stories of Notting Hill through time. The first panel celebrates the area as a pottery and pig farm village in the 19th century, showing ceramic production among young and old residents surrounded by animals with the iconic kilns in the background. The second panel represents an early Portobello Market- now an iconic establishment that shows the relationship between fruit and vegetable vendors and customers which has been vital to adding to the rich vibrancy of the borough’s streets. The third panel shows the intimate moment of a family preparing for the Notting Hill Carnival inside a recently renovated Georgian house.

For the artist, it was important to show the value in reconnecting with our history, our traditions and the people who shaped us to essentially find who we truly are; “As artists, citizens and human being, we need to celebrate the simple and essential moments of life”
