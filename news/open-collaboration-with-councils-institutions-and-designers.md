introduction: The United Generations is looking for collaborations with
  designers, institutions, councils and third sector engaged with social
  practices to develop creative strategies and programs aimed at the wellbeing
  of the older community and the reconciliation of different generations.

On the continuous endeavour to nourish our communities and cities, The United Generations is pleased to launch a global **Open Call** to start conversations about past, current and future strategies looking at the challenges of the ageing population and improving the lives of the older generations. 

The portfolio of projects can range from public art initiatives to improved design strategies for homes, care homes and social care facilities, to communication campaigns that bring awareness to the importance of ageing well.
