Katherine Low Settlement collaborated closely with artist and designer Adalberto Lonardi to develop a series of creative workshop that introduce younger and older participants to basic techniques of drawing. Art is here used to create relationships, discover new hobbies and entertain. The energetic drawing session starts with a moment of mindfulness followed by a series of quick and dynamic exercises aimed to warm up the hand muscles and activate the creative left side of the human brain. The drawing techniques are introduced with an Art Quiz that engages the participants to guess artists based on their signature drawing styles. The laboratory ends with a longer live exercise where the audience is invited to follow the steps of Adalberto who guide step by step participants through the representation of an object.
