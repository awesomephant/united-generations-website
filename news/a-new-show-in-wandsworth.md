Katherine Low Settlement collaborated closely with artist and designer Adalberto Lonardi to develop a series of creative workshops during the Chrismas holidays, to introduce younger and older participants of the KLS community to drawing. Art is here used to create relationships, discover new hobbies and entertain. The energetic drawing session starts with a moment of mindfulness, followed by a series of quick and dynamic exercises aimed to warm up the hand muscles and activate the human brain's creative left side. The drawing techniques are introduced with an Art Quiz that engages the participants to guess artists based on their signature drawing styles. The laboratory ends with a longer live exercise where the audience is invited to follow Adalberto's steps, which guide step by step the participants through the representation of an object.
