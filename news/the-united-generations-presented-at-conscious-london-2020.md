Conscious London is a multidisciplinary team composed by [Studio Jenny Jones](https://studiojennyjones.com/) (CCD Fellow), [Natasha Reid](https://www.matterspacesoul.com/) (CCD Fellow), [Mark Besseudo](https://markbessoudo.com/hi/) (CCD Fellow) focused on human-centred, socially-conscious and science-informed approaches.

The Centre for Conscious Design (CCD) is an international network of experts, researchers and practitioners from a wide range of fields, focused on using conscious design to alleviate complex social and urban issues. The “conscious design” concept emerged out of the Conscious Cities movement which advocates for a healthier, more socially-aware and democratic built environment.
