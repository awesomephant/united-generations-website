    <p>
        In the near future, a significant part of the population is older. Redundant urban land is now fertile. Mobility
        is electric or human-powered. Using findings from my book “How to take care of the old” and from site-specific
        research, a tripartite strategy envisions how the Golden Lane Estate could transform. By intersecting the
        Arcadian landscape into the modernist geometries, I designed a domestic and public scheme where the residents
        and the community are engaged through activities and events that combine social, economic, and cultural values
        contributing to the wellness and the reconnection of old and new generations.
