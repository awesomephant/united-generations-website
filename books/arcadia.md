  disciplines of architecture, sociology, and technology. These fields inform
  the understanding of the fundamental behaviours and needs of the elderly and
  possible future solutions such as co-design, multigenerational living, and
  smart-homes to guarantee our future generationsâ€™ a healthy and comfortable
  senior life.
