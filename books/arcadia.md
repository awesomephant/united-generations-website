intro: This book looks at the relationships between gerontology and the
  disciplines of architecture, sociology, and technology. These fields inform
  the understanding of the fundamental behaviours and needs of the elderly and
  possible future solutions such as co-design, multigenerational living, and
  smart-homes to guarantee our future generationsâ€™ a healthy and comfortable
  senior life.
